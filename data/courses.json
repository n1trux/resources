It covers a wide range of computer security topics, starting from Secure C Coding and Reverse Engineering to Penetration Testing, Exploitation and Web Application Hacking, both from the defensive and the offensive point of view.\n  - [Lectures and Videos](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~redwood/OffensiveComputerSecurity/lectures.html)\n  - [Assignments](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~redwood/OffensiveComputerSecurity/assignments.html)\n- [11-785](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/) **Deep Learning** *Carnegie Mellon University*\n  - The course presents the subject through a series of seminars and labs, which will explore it from its early beginnings, and work themselves to some of the state of the art. The seminars will cover the basics of deep learning and the underlying theory, as well as the breadth of application areas to which it has been applied, as well as the latest issues on learning from very large amounts of data. We will concentrate largely, although not entirely, on the connectionist architectures that are most commonly associated with it. *Lectures* and *Reading Notes* are available on the page.\n\n-----\n\n### Contributing\nHave a few courses in mind that you think are awesome and would fit in this list? Feel free to send a [pull request](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/pulls). However, do note that I'm not keen on adding popular courses (such as MOOCs / MIT OCW) as there are services like [ClassCentral](https://www.class-central.com/) doing a great job of aggregation. This list is ideally for courses which are relatively unknown and make their material (assignments, lectures, exams etc.) available online for free.\n",
